## What is this?

`Quinque` is a collection of fun, interesting image manipulation experiments created using Python. I use `numpy`, `opencv`, `tensorflow`, and more to generate funky remakes of raw images.

## Experiments

Here's a list of all the funky experiments in the repo:

1. **[Pixel Sort](./src/pixel_sort.py)**: What happens when you sort the pixels of an image along different axes?

> More to be added soon!
